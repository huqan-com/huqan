# AXIOM Architecture

## Source of Truth

Use this file as the compact map before making product or architecture claims about AXIOM.

Detailed behavior still lives in tests and code. This document exists to avoid re-reading the whole repository for every high-level decision.

## Core Modules

### Graph Memory

Primary file:

- `graph.js`

Responsibilities:

- node and edge storage
- SQLite primary persistence
- JSON fallback compatibility
- causal relation schema
- deterministic causal traversal

Important relation groups:

- legacy graph relations
- causal relations: `CAUSES`, `PREVENTS`, `ENABLES`, `DEPENDS_ON`, `LEADS_TO`

### Kernel

Primary files:

- `kernel.js`
- `kernel.v2.js`

Responsibilities:

- fact learning
- claim verification
- plugin/capability access
- graph-backed reasoning surface

### Shield

Primary file:

- `lib/shield.js`

Responsibilities:

- classify LLM-assisted responses
- keep `autoLearn` defaulting to `false`
- prevent unsupported and contradicted output from becoming trusted memory

Public labels:

- `graph-backed`
- `llm-assisted`
- `unsupported`
- `contradicted`

### Ingest

Primary file:

- `lib/ingest.js`

Responsibilities:

- route `sourceType` payloads
- normalize ingest input
- call Company Brain and Repo Memory capabilities
- prepare idempotency fields

### Causal Simulator

Primary file:

- `causalSimulator.js`

Responsibilities:

- consume deterministic causal chains
- calculate affected nodes
- produce risk, confidence, evidence, and recommendation
- remain LLM-free and deterministic

### Finalizer

Primary file:

- `finalizer.js`

Responsibilities:

- convert tool and simulation results into structured judgment
- preserve known facts, unknowns, evidence, conclusion, and next questions
- emit causal summaries with traversal metadata

### Workflow Runtime

Primary files:

- `workflow-agent.js`
- `workflow-tools.js`
- `workflow-runtime.js`

Responsibilities:

- deterministic plan/run execution
- tool orchestration
- discovery skeleton wiring

### SDK

Primary file:

- `lib/sdk.js`

Responsibilities:

- dependency-free client wrapper
- LangChain tool wrapper
- Vercel AI middleware wrapper

## Product Surfaces

- CLI: `cli.js`
- REST server: `server.js`
- MCP server: `mcpServer.js`
- Product UI: `public/index.html`
- SDK: `lib/sdk.js`
