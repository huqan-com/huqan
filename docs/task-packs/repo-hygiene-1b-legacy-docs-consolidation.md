# REPO-HYGIENE-1B Legacy Documentation Consolidation

## Purpose

Define the exact, docs-only move contract for consolidating six high-confidence
legacy artifacts into `docs/archive/`. This task-pack does not move, delete,
rewrite, or otherwise modify any legacy document.

## Canonical Base

- Repository: `huqan-com/huqan`
- Required branch: `main`
- Scope-definition base: `d9b7bb7adad519e21de53f4640fa111d417503fe`
- Previous checkpoint: `REPO-HYGIENE-1_LEGACY_DOCS_AUDIT_GREEN`
- Authorized successor: `REPO-HYGIENE-1B_LEGACY_DOCS_CONSOLIDATION`

The scope-definition base records the source state against which this task-pack
was authored. It is not the future implementation base.

The 1B implementation may begin only from the exact post-merge canonical
`main` SHA supplied in a separate implementation authorization after this
task-pack has been merged. Before implementation, the checked-out branch must
be `main`, `HEAD` must equal `origin/main`, `HEAD` must equal that separately
authorized 1B implementation base, and this task-pack must exist unchanged at
that base. Otherwise stop with `BLOCKED_BY_CANONICAL_SOURCE_MISMATCH`.

## Approved Move Set

The implementation gate may make only these byte-preserving moves:

| Source | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| `PUBLIC_RELEASE_POST.md` | `docs/archive/releases/PUBLIC_RELEASE_POST.md` |
| `RELEASE_NOTES_v0.4.0.md` | `docs/archive/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.4.0.md` |
| `RELEASE_NOTES_v2.0.0.md` | `docs/archive/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v2.0.0.md` |
| `RELEASE_V2.md` | `docs/archive/releases/RELEASE_V2.md` |
| `docs/demo-script-v1.md` | `docs/archive/demos/demo-script-v1.md` |
| `.kiro/specs/llm-memory-layer/.config.kiro` | `docs/archive/tooling/kiro/llm-memory-layer/config.kiro` |

The only permitted new file is `docs/archive/README.md`.

## Archive Index Contract

`docs/archive/README.md` must state all of the following:

- Archived documents are not the current-main source of truth.
- Version numbers, SHAs, and test counts inside archived documents are historical
  context.
- Archived content is not a runtime, build, or test input.
- The current demo document is `docs/v4/v4-demo-script.md`.
- Canonical current state is defined by `main` and active roadmap documents.
- Historical release documents must be interpreted together with their Git tags.

## Explicit Exclusions

The following paths are outside the 1B implementation gate:

| Path | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/ADR-006-self-healer-loop.md` | Source-of-truth and supersession decision is unresolved. |
| `docs/ADR-007-self-healer-loop.md` | Source-of-truth and supersession decision is unresolved. |
| `docs/self-healer-roadmap.md` | Requires a separate current-code and ADR reconciliation audit. |
| `.kiro/specs/llm-memory-layer/requirements.md` | Architectural and specification value is unresolved. |
| `docs/v4/v4-demo-script.md` | Active canonical demo document. |
| `docs/v4/big-file-refactor-gate.md` | Historical technical evidence. |
| `docs/launch-uat.md` | Old URLs require the separate `GITHUB-MIGRATION-3A` gate. |

## Historical Integrity Rules

- Do not delete historical release evidence.
- Do not rewrite historical test counts, release claims, versions, or SHAs.
- Do not change Git tags.
- Preserve each moved file byte-for-byte, including the `.config.kiro` to
  `config.kiro` rename.
- Before and after each move, compare SHA-256 hashes. On Windows, use
  `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256`.
- Historical repository URLs are not replaced in this gate. Record that work as
  `DEFER_TO_GITHUB-MIGRATION-3A`.

## Reference Safety Checks

Before and after the implementation, run:

```bash
git grep -n 'PUBLIC_RELEASE_POST.md' -- . || true
git grep -n 'RELEASE_NOTES_v0.4.0.md' -- . || true
git grep -n 'RELEASE_NOTES_v2.0.0.md' -- . || true
git grep -n 'RELEASE_V2.md' -- . || true
git grep -n 'docs/demo-script-v1.md' -- . || true
git grep -n '\\.config\\.kiro' -- . || true
```

If an active build, runtime, workflow, or test reference is found, stop with
`BLOCKED_BY_ACTIVE_DOCUMENT_DEPENDENCY`.

## Expected Diff

The future implementation diff is limited to six renames and one new archive
index:

```text
R  PUBLIC_RELEASE_POST.md
   docs/archive/releases/PUBLIC_RELEASE_POST.md
R  RELEASE_NOTES_v0.4.0.md
   docs/archive/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.4.0.md
R  RELEASE_NOTES_v2.0.0.md
   docs/archive/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v2.0.0.md
R  RELEASE_V2.md
   docs/archive/releases/RELEASE_V2.md
R  docs/demo-script-v1.md
   docs/archive/demos/demo-script-v1.md
R  .kiro/specs/llm-memory-layer/.config.kiro
   docs/archive/tooling/kiro/llm-memory-layer/config.kiro
A  docs/archive/README.md
```

Any additional changed file is `BLOCKED_BY_SCOPE_DRIFT`.

## Validation

The implementation gate must run:

```bash
git diff --summary
git diff --name-status
git diff --check
git status --short
```

Full-suite execution is optional for a byte-preserving docs-only move. If it is
run, the reference baseline is `1936 total / 1907 pass / 0 fail / 29 skipped`.

## Blockers

- `BLOCKED_BY_CANONICAL_SOURCE_MISMATCH`
- `BLOCKED_BY_SCOPE_DRIFT`
- `BLOCKED_BY_ACTIVE_DOCUMENT_DEPENDENCY`
- `BLOCKED_BY_HISTORICAL_EVIDENCE_AMBIGUITY`

## Non-Claims

This task-pack does not authorize:

- changes to README, `docs/launch-uat.md`, or repository URLs;
- ADR-006/007 resolution or `.kiro` requirements disposition;
- runtime, test, fixture, schema, package, or V5 changes;
- branch/tag cleanup or repository settings changes;
- `REPO-HYGIENE-2`, refactoring, or a GitHub migration gate.

## Hard Stop

Even after this task-pack is merged, do not begin 1B automatically. Do not move
or delete legacy files, alter excluded documents, or open a subsequent hygiene
gate without a separate authorization.

The future implementation report must include:
